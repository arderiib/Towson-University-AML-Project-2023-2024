                    Summary

Description: Cleaning Crime Data.R,
    This file cleans the crime data that we recieved from the Open Baltimore data set. 
    Data Set: OpenBaltimore.xlsx

Description: Cleaning Mobility Data.R,
    This cleans the mobility data that we used from Dewey
    Data Set: Not available because it is proprietary information

Description: Cluster_Analysis.ipynb,
		Performs cluster analysis on the crime and mobility data sets utilizinf a spacial join.
		Data Set: Not available because it is proprietary information

Description: K-means clustering for crime and mobility.R,
    This program takes in mobility and crime data,which has already been filtered
    by month,and joins these two dataset's to create a new data frame to conduct 
    the k-means clustering analysis on. The k-means clustering analysis is done for
    all crimes and each unique type of crime. The results are then plotted on a graph
    and automatically exported to the selected folder, for later use.
    Data Set: Not available because it contains measures of mobility defined from the Dewey Data Set

Description: Separated crime and mobility data by month.R,
    This program takes in mobility and crime data and separates the respective
    data frames by month. These are then saved as excels which will be utilized in 
    later programs.
    Data Set: OpenBaltimore.xlsx, Mobility data not included, because it is proprietary

Description: Crime-Mobility-CensusBlockGroup.py,
    Program creates the pictures of the Quadrats that are used in the AML Papper for the 2023-2024 academic year.
    This is also used to perform analysis for the quadrats and to garner that crime intensity is not constant.
